bScript - The lightweight js framework
======================================

What is bScript?
---------------------

It is a lightweight JavaScript framework intended for use on small projects where a large framework is not necessary.

Getting Started
---------------------

1) Simply download the minified version of bScript and reference it in your page.

	<script src="bScript.min.js"></script>

2) Put all of your functions inside the DomLoaded function:

	DomLoaded.load(function() {
	//Insert all super cool functions here
	});

How To
---------------------

Examples of every function can be found on the test page. If you have used other JavaScript frameworks most functions will be familiar to you. For example, to fade in a selector, you would write:

	$('.example-css').fadeIn();
